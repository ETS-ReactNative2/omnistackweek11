## Beyond the challenge

Although this project is based in the project made in the RocketSeat OmniStack week I took some different decisions during the project development. As I am portuguese I deleted some of state logic that was implemented by RocketSeat and replaced it by just a city field in the ONG registration, and as we don't have the habit of using WhatsApp in a day to day basis I changed it to a SMS link using the expo-sms library.
