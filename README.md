# Be The Hero

## Project

This project was developed in the OmniStack Week 11 by [RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), it uses all the power of JavaScript with the Full Stack development using NodeJS, ReactJS and React-Native to put up an application that finds developers according to a given working technology.

## Personal Changes

Although this project is based in the project made in the RocketSeat OmniStack week I took some different decisions during the project development. As I am portuguese I deleted some of state logic that was implemented by RocketSeat and replaced it by just a city field in the ONG registration, and as we don't have the habit of using WhatsApp in a day to day basis I changed it to a SMS link using the expo-sms library.
